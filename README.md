## Welcome!
This GitHub repository has been created as a way to make starting out with programming in Android Studio a bit easier.

## Things Included
- Basic teleop
- Basic time-based auto
- No odometry, vision, etc.
  
## Setup
1. Download Android Studio for your device
2. Download Github Desktop
3. Download Rev Hardware Client
4. Press "Fork" on this repositry page; this will make a copy of this repository.
5. Go to your forked repository and press "clone," then "Open with Github Desktop."
6. Github Desktop should open and allow you to press "clone" again. If asked, select that you'll be using it "for my own purposes."
7. Select "Open in Android Studio."

## Programming
Now you get to begin the most fun (and painful) part. Open the "Teamcode" --> "java" --> "org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode" folders. Here you'll find example TeleOp and Autonomous programs. Good luck!
